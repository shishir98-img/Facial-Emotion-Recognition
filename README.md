# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Hey, this is my first project here on GitHub where i classify CK+48 images bases on 7 diffrent emotions using CNN and Keras.
I have used the CK+48 dataset and divided it into two parts, Test and train. I have shuffled the training dataset and used 3 convolution
layers, a flattening layer, and two fully connected layers. I have used 0.25 dropout to prevent from over fitting. Once it has been trained i have just plotted a Confusion matrix to visualise the results.
